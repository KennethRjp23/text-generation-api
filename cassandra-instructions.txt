- Install with Homebrew:
brew install cassandra

- Start Cassandra Service: 
cassandra -f

- Verify Cassandra is Running:
nodetool status

- Open Cassandra Query Language Shell:
cqlsh

- Create a keyspace and a table:
CREATE KEYSPACE mykeyspace WITH replication = {'class': 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor': 1};
USE mykeyspace;
CREATE TABLE mytable (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    data text
);
* Replication 
- Refers to the process of storing multiple copies of data across different nodes (servers) in a Cassandra cluster.
- Replication ensures high availability and fault tolerance in Cassandra
- If one node goes down, data can still be retrieved from replicas stored on other nodes
- It also improves read performance by allowing requests to be served from the nearest replica
- Simple Strategy: used for single data center deployments or development environments 
- Network Topology Strategy: used for multi-data center deployments, allowing more control over where replicas are placed
- Replication Factor determines how many copies (replicas) of each piece of data are stored across the cluster
- Consistency Level determine how many replicas must respond for the operation to be considered succesful. Higher consistency level requires more replicas to respond,
  ensuring stronger data consistency but potentially impacting perofmance. 

Note: Keyspace in Cassandra is somewhat analogous to a database schema in relational databases.
